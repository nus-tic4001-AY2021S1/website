**_Hand-drawing_ diagrams on a white-board and on paper is an important practical skill** %%(e.g., for technical interviews, project discussions)%%. It's possible that the diagrams you draw in your first few attempts to look amateurish, messy, and hard to read, and the drawing itself will take a long time. With more practice, you will be able to draw such diagrams quicker %%(e.g., draw as you explain verbally your design)%%, with less need for corrections, and the diagrams will look more _professional_ too.

That is why we have structured these tutorials to get everyone to practice this skill so that **your first few (not so good) diagram drawing experiences happen in the tutorial, not in an interview or during your internship.**
