**We are moving tutorials to fully-online mode** from this week.
* **Tutorial submissions will be counted for weekly participation**, as an additional incentive to do tutorial activities. A submission deemed by the instructors as a _reasonable attempt_ (irrespective of the correctness) will be eligible to be counted for participation.
* **Submission deadline: ==11.59am of the following Wednesday==** (same as quizzes).
* **If you encounter problems while doing tutorial tasks**,
  * you can post in the [forum]({{ url_forum }}) as usual.
  * you can also ==**ask in our [:fab-gitter: Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/nus-{{ module | lower }}-{{ semester }}/community)**==. %%We chose Gitter because you can login to Gitter using your GitHub account.%%<br>
   {{ icon_tip }} Use Gitter for questions that can be answered immediately. For things that might need a longer discussion period (e.g., technical issues), post in the forum instead.
* **We recommend that you do the tutorial activity during your actual tutorial time** as both the forum and the Gitter channel will be closely watched by your tutor during that period (i.e., you'll get faster responses). But it is not a hard rule; it is fine as long as you finish the activities by the deadline.
* **You are welcome (even encouraged) to discuss activities/answers with others, but the answers you submit must be your own**.
* **==Use [the file `A________-Tutorial-10.docx`](files//A________-Tutorial-10.docx) as the template==** for your submission. Do follow the submission instructions in that file closely or else our scripts will not be able to detect your submission.<br>
 **Upload your submission to the matching folder on LumiNUS**.
