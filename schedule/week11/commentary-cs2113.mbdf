{% call topic_preamble("Architecture") %}
**While _architecture_ is not of high importance to a small project such as the tP, it is good to know a little bit about it** in case you are thrown into a larger project in future.
{% endcall %}
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
{% call topic_preamble("designApproaches-multilevelDesign-what") %}
**First, let us learn about multi-level design**, a pre-cursor to learning about architecture.
{% endcall %}
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
{% call topic_preamble("architecture-introduction-what") %}
Now that we know about multi-level design, let us learn about architecture, which is a special case of multi-level design. We also cover _architecture diagrams_ here.
{% endcall %}
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
{% call topic_preamble("Architectural Styles") %}
Remember _design patterns_? The _architectural styles_ covered below are like 'design patterns' at architecture level. As before, we only cover two of them just to give you a taste of the topic while keeping the workload low.
{% endcall %}
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
{% call topic_preamble("Types of Testing") %}
As we approach the last part of the tP, we'll be spending more time learning about software testing. This week, we start off with an overview of different _types_ of software testing.
{% endcall %}
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
{% call topic_preamble("testing-dependencyInjection-what") %}
_Dependency Injection_ is a technique closely related to stubs. It is not in the syllabus but is given below in case some of you would like to know more about it.
{% endcall %}
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
{% call topic_preamble("Test Case Design") %}
Last week, we learned how to measure test _coverage_. This week, we look into how to increase coverage with the least number of test cases.

First, we take a look at test case design in general, different approaches to test case design, and few different categorization of test cases.
{% endcall %}
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
{% call topic_preamble("testCaseDesign-introduction-what") %}
**What is _test case design_, and why should we care?**

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
{% call topic_preamble("testCaseDesign-introduction-blackVsGlass") %}
**How much information about the code is being used when designing test cases?**

{% call topic_preamble("Equivalence Partitioning") %}
Our syllabus includes two specific techniques for improving test case design. This week, we cover one of them: _equivalence partitioning_.
