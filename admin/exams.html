<p class="lead">There is no midterm exam. Information about the final exam is given below.</p>
<ul>
<li>The final exam will be as per the normal exam schedule, and will count for 30% of the final grade.</li>
<li>The exam will be done online.</li>
<li><mark><strong>We will be following the <a href="https://mysoc.nus.edu.sg/academic/e-exam-sop-for-students/">SoC's E-Exam SOP</a></strong></mark>, combined with the deviations/refinements given in the section below. Please read the SOP carefully and ensure you follow all instructions.</li></ul>
<h2 id="sop-deviations-refinements">SOP deviations/refinements<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#sop-deviations-refinements" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Tools: LumiNUS, Zoom, Microsoft Teams (MST), PDF scanner</strong>, PDF reader.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>The webcam view should capture all three</strong> of these: your upper body (side view), the entire screen area of your monitor, the working area of the table. Here is an example:<br>
<img src="/website/admin/images/zoomCameraExample.png" width="367"></p></li>
<li>
<p><mark><strong>Recording of your PC screen</strong> is not required.</mark></p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Only one computer screen</strong> is allowed.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Not allowed to use the printer or other devices during the exam.</strong></p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Soft copies of notes: only PDF format is allowed.</strong> Other formats (e.g., MS Word, .txt, html) are not allowed. No limitation on what the PDF file contains or the number of PDF files to be used.<br>
You may use any hard copies or written materials too.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Browser should only be used to access LumiNUS.</strong> Accessing other websites (including the module website) is not allowed.<br>
It turns out that the textbook PDF file plays better with browsers than PDF viewers. Therefore, <mark>viewing the textbook PDF in the browser is allowed. But other PDFs should be opened in a PDF viewer</mark>.<br>
<span class="dimmed">The reason for restricting the use of the browser to view PDF files is that allowing it makes it harder for invigilators to detect students accessing unauthorized websites.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use Microsoft Teams or Zoom private messages to communicate with the invigilator</strong>.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>The quiz will not appear on LumiNUS until a few minutes before we release the password</strong>. Wait until we announce that the quiz is available to see.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>When the invigilator asks you to do an <em>identity check</em></strong>, turn your face towards the camera, move closer to the camera, remove face mask (if any), and hold the pose until the invigilator tells you to go back to your working position.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>If you have a doubt/query about a question</strong>, or want to make an assumption about a question, please write it down in the 'justification' text box. <mark>Do not try to communicate those with the invigilator during the exam.</mark> We'll take your doubt/query/assumption into account when grading. For example, if many had queries about a specific question, we can conclude that the question is unclear and omit it from grading.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>If you encounter a serious problem</strong> that prevents you from proceeding with the exam (e.g., the password to open the quiz doesn't work), PM the invigilator using MS Teams (failing that, use Zoom chat).</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>If your computer crashed/restarted</strong> during the exam, try to get it up again and resume the exam. LumiNUS will allow you to resume from where you stopped earlier. However, note that there is a deadline to finish the quiz and you will overrun that deadline if you lose more than 5 minutes due to the computer outage.</p></li></ol>
<h2 id="format">Format<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#format" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The exam will be divided into 2 parts.</li></ul>
<h3 id="final-exam-part-1">Final exam - part 1<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#final-exam-part-1" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A LumiNUS quiz containing 16 MCQ questions. All questions are estimated to be equal size/difficulty.</li>
<li>You only need to answer 15 questions correctly to get full marks. The extra question is there to cushion you against careless mistakes or misinterpreting a question.</li>
<li>Questions will appear in random order.</li>
<li>You will not be able to go back to previous questions.<br>
<span class="dimmed">Reasons:<br>
1. to minimize opportunities for collusion<br>
2. not unreasonable for the materials tested and the proficiency level expected -- i.e., when using this knowledge in a real life SE project discussion, it will be rare for you to go back to revise what you said earlier in the discussion</span></li>
<li>Duration: <strong>35 minutes</strong> </li>
<li>You are required to give a justification for your answer. <mark>The question will specify what should be included in the justification. <strong>Answers without the correct justification may not earn full marks.</strong></mark> However, we'll give full marks up to two correct answers (per 16 questions) that do not have justifications <span class="dimmed">(to cater for cases where you accidentally proceeded to the next question before adding the justification)</span>.</li>
<li>Here is an example question. The answer is <code v-pre>a</code> and the justification can be <code v-pre>OOP is only one of the choices for an SE project</code>.</li></ul>
<div class="indented-level2">
<panel haader="A sample question" expanded>
<p>Choose the incorrect statement.</p>
<p><span class="text-info">[Justification: why is it incorrect?]</span></p>
<ul radio-group="c2818" class="radio-list">
<li class="radio-list-item"><label><input class="radio-list-input" name="c2818" type="radio"> a. Software engineering projects always use OOP.</label></li>
<li class="radio-list-item"><label><input class="radio-list-input" name="c2818" type="radio"> b. Some software engineering projects can be large and complex.</label></li>
<li class="radio-list-item"><label><input class="radio-list-input" name="c2818" type="radio"> c. Some software engineering projects can go on for many years.</label></li></ul></panel>
<p></p></div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="badge badge-pill badge-warning"><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-lightbulb"></span></span> Almost all questions will ask you to choose the INCORRECT statement and justify why it is incorrect.</p></li>
<li>
<p>There will be a 5-minutes toilet break after this part</p></li></ul>

<h3 id="final-exam-part-2-2">Final exam - part 2<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#final-exam-part-2-2" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Similar to part 1 (e.g., 16 questions, same length).</li></ul>
<h2 id="exam-briefing-mock-exam-practice-exam-paper">Exam briefing, mock exam, practice exam paper<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#exam-briefing-mock-exam-practice-exam-paper" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>There will be an exam briefing in the penultimate lecture. It will include a minimal mock exam, just to help you understand the structure.</li>
<li>You will be given a practice exam paper (half the size of the full paper) to help you practice timing. That practice paper will be released at least one week before the exam.</li></ul></div>
